          <h2>Oversized Crochet Cardigan</h2>
			    <p>	
				    This is almost a one fits all kind of pattern. However, if you are a larger size and want it to be even bigger, you would simply add a few more rows to the initial back chain.
				    I used 10 balls of yarn hoops & threads charisma bulky yarn in grey (109 yards per skein)
					    8mm hook
			    </p>
			    <p>
				     TO BEGIN:
				   </p>
			       <ul>
				      <li>
						    ROW 1<br>
					      Ch 60. (my chain measures 65-70cm, this is where you increase for a larger size)
					       place 1 SC in the second chain from the hook, Ch 1, Skip 1 chain place 1 SC in the second chain from hook. Repeat for entire row.
					     </li>
					      <li>
						       ROW 2<br>
						        Chain 2, Flip over work.Place 1 SC in the first chain 1 space, Ch 1, place 1 SC  in the next chain 1 space. Repeat until end of row
							      Repeat row 2 for entire back piece.(My back piece measures 72cm)
					       </li>
					       <li>
						TO BEGIN ON FRONT PANELS:<br>
							Don't fasten off once you reach the length for the back piece.Place 2 chain markers in the center 2 chains of the back piece.
							Continue working yarn and pattern on one side until you reach the first chain marker, stopping on a SC.
					</li>
					<li>
						NEXT ROW:<br>
						Ch 2, flip over work.(This is a decrease row)
						Place hook through first ch1 space, yarn over pull through, place hook directly through next ch 1 space, yarn over pull through, with 4 loops on your hook, yarn over pull through 2, yarn over pull through 2. (This completes the first decrease)
							Ch 1, place 1 SC in the next ch 1 space. continue pattern as normal to the end of the row.
					</li>
					<li>
						NEXT ROW:<br>
						(This is not a decrease row. you are decreasing every other row, 4 decrease rows total)
						ch 2, flip over work. continue moss stitch as usual until end of row.
						Repeat until you have 4 decrease rows total.Once you complete 4 decrease rows, continue moss stitch rows as usual until you reach the same length as the back panel.
							Fasten off.
							Re-attach working yarn on other side and repeat once more for second panel.
							Then Fasten off again.
						    Place a row of SC connecting sides together to create arm space,
			                I leave a 7 inch space from the shoulder to the armpit.
				  </li>
					<li>
						TO BEGIN ON SLEEVE:<br>

							Ribbing-
							Ch 12, place 1 SC in second chain from hook.
							cont placing 1 SC in every stitch of row.
					</li>
					<li>
						ROW 2<br>
							Ch 1, place 1 SC in the back stitch of every stitch in the row.

							Repeat row 2, until it fits comfortably around your wrist, I completed 20 rows.
							(for a larger size, you could add a couple more rows to the ribbing to achieve a larger sleeve)
							Don't fasten off, now working along the side of the ribbing
							Fit 37 SC along the side.

							Continue original moss stitch for the remaining length of the sleeve.
							I complete about 35 rows for my size.
							Fasten off.
							Make 2 sleeves.
					</li>
					<li>
						TO ATTACH:<br>
						Flip body inside out, attach shoulders to sleeves, then continue down sleeve lengths with SC

							I also add an edging along the collar and bottom, you can refer to my youtube video!
							it's just a basic SC stitch.
					</li>
